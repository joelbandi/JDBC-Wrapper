DONE::

Print out (to the screen) the movies featuring a given star.
 All movie attributes should appear, labeled and neatly arranged; the 
 star can be queried via first name and/or last name or by ID. First 
 name and/or last name means that a star should be queried by both
  a) first name AND last name b) first name or last name.


Insert a new star into the database. 
If the star has a single name, add it as his last_name and assign an 
empty string ("") to first_name.



Insert a customer into the database. 
Do not allow insertion of a customer if his credit card 
does not exist in the credit card table.
 The credit card table simulates the bank records. 
 If the customer has a single name, add it as his last_name 
 and assign an empty string ("") to first_name.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PENDING::

Delete a customer from the database.






Provide the metadata of the database; in particular,
 print out the name of each table and, for each table, each attribute and its type.







Enter a valid SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE SQL command. 
The system should take the corresponding action, and return
and display the valid results. For a SELECT query, display the answers.
For the other types of queries, give enough information about the status 
of the execution of the query. For instance, for an UPDATE query,
show the user how many records have been successfully changed.







Exit the menu (and return to the get-the-database/user/password state)






Exit the program.
